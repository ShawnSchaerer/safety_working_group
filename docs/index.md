# ROS Safety Working Group

This is the information page for the ROS Safety Working Group.
The Safety WG devotes itself to doing all the boring bits of building safe robots using ROS.

The Safety WG meets via teleconference every two weeks.
For the next working group meeting, see the [ROS 2 events calendar](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Governance/#upcoming-ros-events).

The working group has no official membership.
Anyone is welcome to participate and contribute at the level they see fit.

## Working group activities

Currently the Safety WG is still in its start-up phase.
Its initial focus is on producing a catalogue of architectural patterns commonly used in safety-critical systems and how to implement them using ROS 2.

The working group welcomes ideas and concepts for additional activities.
If you have an idea for something you would like the working group to put energy into, join the next working group meeting and introduce your idea.

## Safety Patterns Catalogue

[The Safety Patterns Catalogue](safety_patterns_catalogue.html) provides examples of how to implement common safety-critical architectural patterns in ROS 2.
For ideas on how to achieve things such as truly-redundant structures or voting-based reliability mechanisms, see this catalogue.

If an architecture pattern you need or know is not in the catalogue, [make a pull request](https://github.com/ros2/safety_working_group/pulls) to add it!
